<h2> Summer Internship Project </h2>
<h3> Objective </h3>

<p> As a part of this internship, I would like to add on to the progress that I have made from the Fisk Hackathon, as well as the Fisk Research Symposium. My goal is to create a user-friendly and interactive website in which users can search for occulational opportunities with ease.</p>
	
<h4> May 31, 2016 </h4>

<p> Today, I went through the Angular JS tutorial on w3schools. I also delved into research concerning interactive maps and I am just trying to gain a better understanding of the coding and processes involved in making objects interactive.
